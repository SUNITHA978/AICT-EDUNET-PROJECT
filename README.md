# AICTE-EDUNET-PROJECT
This project focuses on building a simple yet effective AI model to automatically classify emails as spam or not spam. With the overwhelming amount of emails received daily, manually identifying spam can be both inefficient and error-prone. An automated solution ensures a cleaner inbox and better email management.

Binary classification of emails: Spam vs. Not Spam
Preprocessing of raw email data using NLP techniques
Training a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM)
Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Easy-to-run Python script with command-line output

Python
scikit-learn
Pandas / NumPy
NLTK or spaCy (for text preprocessing)
Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts

Model Workflow:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Remove punctuation, stopwords, and perform tokenization
Feature Extraction
Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
Model Training
Train using traditional ML algorithms
Model Evaluation
Validate the performance on test data
Prediction
Predict whether new emails are spam or not
